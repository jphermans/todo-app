Thanks for your interest in contributing to the **Todo App**!  
This project is a lightweight, modern, and responsive Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React and Vite.

   ```
3. Create a new branch for your changes:

npm run dev
```

## ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines

- Keep changes minimal and focused on a single task.
- Follow existing code conventions.
- Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., `fix: handle offline mode`, `feat: add dark mode toggle`).

This project aims to support multiple languages.  
If you want to contribute translations:

   ```
2. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
